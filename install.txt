Quick install guide
===================

Before you can use Django, you'll need to get it installed.

Install Python on Windows
=========================

Download and install https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.0/python-3.6.0-amd64.exe

.. admonition:: Be careful during installation!

    One thing to watch out for: Make sure you tick the "Add Python 3.6 to PATH" checkbox before installing, as shown below. If not, you will not be able to run ``python`` in your shell.

Launch Shell on Windows
=======================

Go to Start menu and search for ``cmd`` and open the command prompt/shell.

You can verify that Python is installed by typing ``python`` from your shell;
you should see something like::

    C:\Users\alex>python
    Python 3.6.x
    [GCC 4.x] on linux
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>>

Press ``Ctrl + D`` to exit.

Install Python on Mac
=====================

https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.0/python-3.6.0-macosx10.6.pkg

Other Installers
================

Set up a database
=================

Python includes a lightweight database called SQLite so you won't need to set up a database.

Install Django
==============

::

    C:\Users\alex\>pip install django

Is Django installed?
====================

To verify that Django can be seen by Python, type ``python`` from your shell.
Then at the Python prompt, try to import Django:

.. parsed-literal::

    >>> import django
    >>> print(django.get_version())
    |version|

You may have another version of Django installed.

That's it!

That's it -- you can now :doc:`move onto the tutorial <tutorial01>`.
